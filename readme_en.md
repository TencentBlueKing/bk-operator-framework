[中文文档](readme.md)

Bof is a framework for building Kubernetes APIs using [Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions).

Similar to web development frameworks like *Django* and *Flask*, Bof accelerates development and reduces the complexity that developers need to manage when quickly building and deploying Kubernetes APIs using the Python language. It is based on the core technologies used to build Kubernetes APIs, providing simple abstractions that reduce boilerplate code and tedious tasks.

Bof is not a *copy-paste* example but offers a powerful library and tools to simplify the process of building and deploying Kubernetes APIs from scratch. It features a plugin architecture that allows users to leverage optional auxiliary tools and functionalities.

Bof is developed based on the [kopf](https://github.com/nolar/kopf.git) and [pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic.git) libraries.
